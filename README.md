# Omegle Notification Sounds Chrome Extension
This Chrome Extension adds a notification sound when receiving new messages on [Omegle](https://omegle.com). You may disable the sounds by clicking on the extension icon next to the address bar and toggling the checkbox while on the website.

## Getting Started

1. Download this repository to a location of your choice.

2. Open the Extension Management page by navigating to [chrome://extensions]. The Extension Management page can also be opened by clicking on the Chrome menu, hovering over More Tools then selecting Extensions.
Enable Developer Mode by clicking the toggle switch next to Developer mode.

3. Click the LOAD UNPACKED button and select the extension directory.

That's about it!

## Acknowledgements
Thanks to Chrome for their easy-to-follow [Getting Started](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted) guide which helped me learn how to make Chrome Extensions. 

## Future Plans
I plan to allow users to choose their own notification sound by providing a link. Currently we use [this sound](https://notificationsounds.com/message-tones/appointed-529).
